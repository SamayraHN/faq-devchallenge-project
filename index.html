<body>
    <h2 id="order">I haven't received an order confirmation</h2>
    <p>We're so sorry that you haven't received your order confirmation yet! We know how frustrating that can be. Sometimes, these emails can accidentally end up in your spam or junk folder, so it's worth checking there. If you still can't find it, please double-check that your email address was entered correctly when placing the order. If everything looks good, don't worryâ€”our customer support team is here to help and can quickly verify your order and resend the confirmation. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience!</p>
    <h3 id="return">What is the return policy?</h3>
    <p>The return policy generally allows you to return products within a certain timeframe, often 30 days, for a full refund or exchange, provided the items are in their original condition. Always check specific return guidelines on the website or your receipt, as some items may be non-returnable or have specific conditions.</p>
    <h4 id="track">How to track my order? </h4>
    <p>We completely understand how important it is to track your order! Once your package has shipped, you should receive a tracking number via email. We use Royal Mail to ship our orders, so you can copy and paste the tracking number directly into their website to track your delivery. Simply follow <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/track-your-item" target="_blank">this link</a> to Royal Mail's tracking page and enter your tracking number. You may also be able to track your order directly from your account on our website. If you need any help, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
    <h5 id="update">Why am I unable to update my account details?</h5>
    <p>If you're unable to update your account details, try logging out and back in, clearing your browser cache, or trying another browser. If the issue persists, contact customer support for technical help. They can either fix the issue or update your information for you.</p>
